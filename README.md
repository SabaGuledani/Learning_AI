# Learning_AI
Here are some courses, links, and resources which I use to learn AI.

## data science 
Learn basics of Data Science with python Pandas library.

### Keith Galli Crash course 
[Keith Galli Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KeithGalli/videos)

learn basics of Pandas in one hour. [link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg&t=1s)

### training on real world problem example Pandas
Deepen knowledge and train on example of Data Science real world problem task with Keith.

## NumPy 
learn basics of NumPy with Keith Galli's [NumPy Crash Course](https://youtu.be/GB9ByFAIAH4?si=JgOXobbQULbv3WlG).
Main points are: understanding NumPy Arrays, how to access certain elements, how to initialize different types and understanding shapes and reshaping.
All of those are necessary for preprocessing the data to feed the NN model.

# Andrew Ng ML and AI courses(Coursera)

## Learning Calculus for ML
Optional if you already know calculus, but recommended if you have difficulty understanding next course.

## Machine Learning Specialization 
(I should have started with these courses but started with other ones, but you better start with these ones.)
